[Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19dxKKtLBQGtWEflvYCa6ArgLPKNUbb8g/view?usp=sharing)

I currently work in Amsterdam as a Dev Engineer at a bank.

Previously, I was a Masters student in Simulation Sciences at [RWTH Aachen University, Germany](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/a/?lidx=1). 
My course was an interdisciplinary course offered at the [AICES](https://aices.rwth-aachen.de/en/home) (The Aachen Institute for Advanced Study in Computational Engineering Science) graduate school.
To the uninitiated, it is essentially like Computational Science/ Applied Mathematics.

I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant at the [Computational Biomedicine](https://www.combine.rwth-aachen.de/) department of
the University where I worked with an interdisciplinary team consisting of people with medical, physics, computer science and mathematics backgrounds. I got to work with ICU patient data and electronic health records, which has led me to appreciate how much effort goes into cleaning and preprocessing wild data to make it usable.

My Masters thesis work was in the same department on the topic "Feature selection for patient population discrimination".

Before my MSc. studies, I worked at Oracle as an Applications Engineer in Mobile Sales Cloud team, under Fusion CRM. I worked on making a hybrid mobile app wherein the same codebase could be deployed as a .ipa (Apple products) or .apk(Android) , thereby reducing development time and improving code reuse. 

I completed my Bachelor in Technology from the Indian Institute of Technology- Roorkee ([IIT - Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/)) in Metallurgical and Materials engineering.
