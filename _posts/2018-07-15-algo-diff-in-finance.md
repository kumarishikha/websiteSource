**Computational Differentiation : Use case - Finance**

The aim of this seminar was to pick up a paper, understand it thoroughly and then present it to a group of people, considering they are not experts in the field.
I was provided the paper *Uwe Naumann and Jacques du Toit. Adjoint Algorithmic Differentiation Tool
Support for Typical Numerical Patterns in Computational Finance. 2014* and I presented the following presentation and report as deliverables.

Note : The course involved writing a review paper. Any code/ computation/ results is that of the authors of the paper.
